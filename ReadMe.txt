MythBattle -
This was my final year project at University. It's a trading card game similar to Hearthstone with a few unique twists. This is the project I have spent the most time on.
It was created with C# and Unity. The game is based around different mythologys. It allows users to build a deck and play against an AI. It was built for android.
To see any programming please navigate to: \Rugen_John_FullProject\Rugen_John_SourceProject\MythCardBattle\Assets\Scripts.
I have included the documentation files I used whilst completing this project, this includes a Feasability document along with design & balance documents. 
I haven't included my dissertation.

Artificially Inadequate - 
This project spanned a whole final year units coursework. The first piece of coursework was to create a game within Unreal Engine. I decided to create a third person game.
The game features AI with three different behaviours. Hide, Run and Hostile. Each AI made use of Unreal Engines blackboard + Behaviour tree systems.
The second part of the coursework was to create a Treatment document for the game. This is included within this repo.
(The source file for this project isn't included however it can be retrieved upon request. There is a gameplay video included)

BillaGolf - 
This project was created within my final year at University. It makes use of C++ and OpenGL. It's a game in which you play a game of pool as if it was golf.

Spaceman - 
This project was created within my 2nd year at University. It makes use of C++ and OpenGL. The user has to jump over obstacles, it's an endless runner with increasing difficulty.
